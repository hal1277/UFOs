# UFOs

## Overview
The project was to help Diana build an interactive webpage on UFO sightings to conincide with World UFO Day.  Initially build with one filter the website was then enchanced to allow for multiple filters.  

## Results 
Here is an image of the webiste design.  It started with a storyboard to properly visualize the desired layout. The HTML file was then created to realize that vision which was laid out.  Formatting created a visualing appealing dark them for the page and a background image in the jumbotron re-inforces the space theme of the site.

After updating the intial code the table can now be filtered on date, city, state, country, and shape - all 5 or just 1 or anything in between.  

Perhaps you want to see only the triangle shaped sighting on Jan. 1, 2010?

Or maybe it's only the light sightings in the state of california that interest you?

The filter possibilites are immense.  You simply type into the field the indicated type of criteria (i.e. state in the state field or shape in the shape field) and the table will automatically filter to just those results meeting all the selected filters.  You can also remove filter critera by simply removing what you have typed in any given field.  

## Summary
While the current design offers substantial filtering flexibility there are still some drawbacks. There is no option for sorting the filtered table data for instance.  

In the next improvement iteration here are some enchanments that could take Diana's webpage to even higher levels of performance:

    1. Link the site to an API call so that the table data is getting refreshed as new sighting data becomes available rather than linking it to a static table.  

    2. Update the table to include links so that users can easily find more info about any particular sighting that intests them.   

    3. Update the filter to work on partial rather than exact matches.  This would make the site more user friendly when some of the fields have formats that haven't been strictly followed.
